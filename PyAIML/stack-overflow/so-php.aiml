      ALLOW PLUGIN FOR A PHP APPLIC

<![CDATA[<p>You could use an Observer pattern.  A simple functional way to accomplish this:</p><br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;?php<br><br>/** Plugin system **/<br><br>$listeners = array();<br><br>/* Create an entry point for plugins */<br>function hook(){<br>  global $listeners;<br><br>  $num_args = func_num_args();<br>  $args = func_get_args();<br><br>  if($num_args &lt; 2)<br>    trigger_error("Insufficient arguments", E_USER_ERROR);<br><br>  // Hook name should always be first argument<br>  $hook_name = array_shift($args);<br><br>  if(!isset($listeners[$hook_name]))<br>    return; // No plugins have registered this hook<br><br>  foreach($listeners[$hook_name] as $func){<br>    $args = $func($args); <br>  }<br><br>  return $args;<br>}<br><br>/* Attach a function to a hook */<br>function add_listener($hook, $function_name){<br>  global $listeners;<br><br>  $listeners[$hook][] = $function_name;<br>}<br><br><br>/////////////////////////<br><br>/** Sample Plugin **/<br>add_listener('a_b', 'my_plugin_func1');<br>add_listener('str', 'my_plugin_func2');<br><br>function my_plugin_func1($args){<br>  return array(4, 5);<br>}<br>function my_plugin_func2($args){<br>  return str_replace('sample', 'CRAZY', $args[0]);<br>}<br><br>/////////////////////////<br><br>/** Sample Application **/<br><br>$a = 1;<br>$b = 2;<br><br>list($a, $b) = hook('a_b', $a, $b);<br><br>$str  = "This is my sample application\n";<br>$str .= "$a + $b = ".($a+$b)."\n";<br>$str .= "$a * $b = ".($a*$b)."\n";<br><br>$str = hook('str', $str);<br><br>echo $str;<br><br>?&gt;<br></code></pre><br/><br/><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><br/><br/><pre><code>This is my CRAZY application<br>4 + 5 = 9<br>4 * 5 = 20<br></code></pre><br/><br/><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><br/><br/><p>For this example source code, you must declare all your plugins before the actual source code that you want to be extendable.  I've included an example of how to handle single or multiple values being passed to the plugin.  The hardest part of this is writing the actual documentation which lists what arguments get passed to each hook.</p><br/><br/><p>This is just one method of accomplishing a plugin system in PHP.  There are better alternatives, I suggest you check out the WordPress Documentation for more information.</p><br/><br/><p><em>Sorry, it appears underscore characters are replaced by HTML entities by Markdown?

You can even regenerate the session id every request if you wish.</li><br/><li>Have sessions time out</li><br/><li>Don't use register globals</li><br/><li>Store authentication details on the server. That is, don't send details such as username in the cookie.</li><br/><li>Check the <code>$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']</code>. This adds a small barrier to session hijacking. You can also check the IP address. But this causes problems for users that have changing IP address due to load balancing on multiple internet connections etc (which is the case in our environment here).</li><br/><li>Lock down access to the sessions on the file system or use custom session handling</li><br/><li>For sensitive operations consider requiring logged in users to provide their authenication details again</li><br/></ol><br/>]]>    </template>

      IMPLEMENT UNIT TEST IN PHP
    </pattern>
    <template>
<![CDATA[<p>I've tried SimpleTest and PHPUnit, and stuck with PHPUnit because it works with PHP 5, and SimpleUnit seemed to throw a lot of notices and warnings (I like to develop with full error reporting turned on, there's no excuse for sloppy code). I also came across numerous bugs with SimpleTest (some of which caused me hours of wasted productivity and stress in trying to track them down).</p><br/><br/><p>In terms of how unit-testing helps development, I find TDD (Test Driven Development) to be the best paradigm, because it forces you to think exactly how your code will be used before you write any of it. In fact, since I've adopted unit-testing and tdd, I've rewritten much of my own code because in writing tests for them, I've realised that my method names and functions weren't exactly the most intuitive, and also did some things that they shouldn't have been doing (i.e. like doing two tasks, instead of being specific and just do one each).</p><br/><br/><p>Not only that, but writing tests for your code helps you understand your own code better (i.e. in that it helps you realise when your all-singing-and-dancing class is doing too many different things, and should be split up into different distinct components), and also helps others understand your code (because if you write your tests properly and elegantly, they can see how they're supposed to use your class - it's almost like writing code examples).</p><br/><br/><p>There's a good guide <a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/817-Quality-Assurance-in-PHP-Projects.html" rel="nofollow">involving a bowling game here</a> that gives you an insight to both PHPUnit and TDD, and that should help you get started. It starts from slide 14.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

    </pattern>
    <template>
<![CDATA[<p>In the Rails world, there's the concept of migrations, scripts in which changes to the database are made in Ruby rather than a database-specific flavour of SQL. Your Ruby migration code ends up being converted into the DDL specific to your current database; this makes switching database platforms very easy. </p><br/><br/><p>For every change you make to the database, you write a new migration. Migrations typically have two methods: an "up" method in which the changes are applied and a "down" method in which the changes are undone. A single command brings the database up to date, and can also be used to bring the database to a specific version of the schema. In Rails, migrations are kept in their own directory in the project directory and get checked into version control just like any other project code.</p><br/><br/><p><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/kern-rails-migrations.html" rel="nofollow" title="Oracle guide to Ruby on Rails migrations">This Oracle guide to Rails migrations</a> covers migrations quite well.</p><br/><br/><p>Developers using other languages have looked at migrations and have implemented their own language-specific versions.

<![CDATA[<p>We were in a similar situation, and here's what we ended up doing:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/><li>Set up two branches -- the release and development branch.</li><br/><li>For the development branch, include a post-commit hook that deploys the repository to the dev server, so you can test.</li><br/><li>Once you're ready, you merge your changes into the release branch. I'd also suggest putting in a post-commit hook for deployment there.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>You can also set up individual development servers for each of the team members, on their workstations. I find that it speeds things up a bit, although you do have some more setup time.</p><br/><br/><p>We had to use a single development server, because we were using a proprietary CMS and ran into licensing issues.

<![CDATA[<p>I also once worked on an app which used PHP4's XML support quite heavily, and would have required quite a bit of work to move to PHP5.</p><br/><br/><p>One of the other significant changes I was looking at at the time was the change of the default handling of function parameters. In PHP4 if I remember, they were pass-by-copy unless you specified otherwise, but in PHP5 is changed to pass-by-reference by default. In well written code, that probably won't make a big difference to you, but it could certainly cause problems.</p><br/><br/><p>I think one other thing I found changed is that objects are no longer allowed to overwrite their 'this' field. I would say that was a really bad idea to begin with (and I think it may have not been an intentional feature in PHP4), but I certainly found a few parts of our system that relied on it.</p><br/><br/><p>Hope some of that helps.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

      INDEX ARRAY INDEX VS ARRAY INDEX VS ARRAY INDEX

<![CDATA[<p>see @svec and @jeremy above.  All array indices are of type 'int' first, then type 'string', and will be cast to that as PHP sees fit.</p><br/><br/><p>Performance wise, $index should be faster than "$index" and "{$index}" (which are the same).  </p><br/><br/><p>Once you start a double-quote string, PHP will go into interpolation mode and treat it as a string first, but looking for variable markers ($, {}, etc) to replace from the local scope.  This is why in most discussions, true 'static' strings should always be single quotes unless you need the escape-shortcuts like "\n" or "\t", because PHP will not need to try to interpolate the string at runtime and the full string can be compiled statically.</p><br/><br/><p>In this case, doublequoting will first copy the $index into that string, then return the string, where directly using $index will just return the string.</p>]]>    </template>

<![CDATA[<p>If you are taking a 'fill in the blank' approach, you can precisely position text anywhere you want on the page.

For example with Zend Framework:</p><br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;?php<br/>require_once 'Zend/Pdf.php';<br/><br/>$pdf = Zend_Pdf::load('blank.pdf');<br/>$page = $pdf-&gt;pages[0];<br/>$font = Zend_Pdf_Font::fontWithName(Zend_Pdf_Font::FONT_HELVETICA);<br/>$page-&gt;setFont($font, 12);<br/>$page-&gt;drawText('Hello world!', 72, 720);<br/>$pdf-&gt;save('zend.pdf');<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>If you're trying to replace inline content, such as a "[placeholder string]," it gets much more complicated. While it's technically possible to do, you're likely to mess up the layout of the page.</p><br/><br/><p>A PDF document is comprised of a set of primitive drawing operations: line here, image here, text chunk there, etc. It does not contain any information about the layout intent of those primitives.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

      RAW EMAIL IN PHP
    </pattern>
    <template>
<![CDATA[<p>What are you hoping to end up with at the end?  The body, the subject, the sender, an attachment?  You should spend some time with <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html" rel="nofollow" title="Dr. Explain">RFC2822</a> to understand the format of the mail, but here's the simplest rules for well formed email:</p><br/><br/><pre><code>HEADERS\n<br/>\n<br/>BODY<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>That is, the first blank line (double newline) is the separator between the HEADERS and the BODY.  A HEADER looks like this:</p><br/><br/><pre><code>HSTRING:HTEXT<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>HSTRING always starts at the beginning of a line and doesn't contain any white space or colons.  HTEXT can contain a wide variety of text, including newlines as long as the newline char is followed by whitespace.</p><br/><br/><p>The "BODY" is really just any data that follows the first double newline.  (There are different rules if you are transmitting mail via SMTP, but processing it over a pipe you don't have to worry about that).</p><br/><br/><p>So, in really simple, circa-1982 <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html" rel="nofollow">RFC822</a> terms, an email looks like this:</p><br/><br/><pre><code>HEADER: HEADER TEXT<br/>HEADER: MORE HEADER TEXT<br/>  INCLUDING A LINE CONTINUATION<br/>HEADER: LAST HEADER<br/><br/>THIS IS ANY<br/>ARBITRARY DATA<br/>(FOR THE MOST PART)<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>Most modern email is more complex than that though.  Headers can be encoded for charsets or <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2047.html" rel="nofollow">RFC2047</a> mime words, or a ton of other stuff I'm not thinking of right now.  The bodies are really hard to roll your own code for these days to if you want them to be meaningful.  Almost all email that's generated by an MUA will be <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2045.html" rel="nofollow">MIME</a> encoded.  That might be uuencoded text, it might be html, it might be a uuencoded excel spreadsheet.</p><br/><br/><p>I hope this helps provide a framework for understanding some of the very elemental buckets of email.  If you provide more background on what you are trying to do with the data I (or someone else) might be able to provide better direction.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

<![CDATA[<p>I recently introduced Python to my company, which does consulting work for the Post Office.  I did this by waiting until there was a project for which I would be the only programmer, then getting permission to do this new project in Python.  I then did another small project in Python with similarly impressive results.  In addition, I used Python for all of my small throwaway assignments ("can you parse the stats in these files into a CSV file organized by date and site?", etc) and had a quick turnaround time on all of them.</p><br/><br/><p>I also evangelized Python a bit; I went out of my way to NOT be obnoxious about it, but I'd occasionally describe why I liked it so much, talked about the personal projects I use it for in my free time and why it's awesome for me, etc.</p><br/><br/><p>Eventually we started another project and I convinced everyone to use Python for it.  I took care to point everyone to a lot of documentation, including the specific webpages relating to what they were working on, and every time they had a question, I'd explain how to do things properly by explaining the Pythonic approach to things, etc.</p><br/><br/><p>This has worked really well.  However, this might be somewhat different than what you're describing.  In my case I started with moderately small projects and Python is only being used for new projects.  Also, none of my co-workers were really Perl or PHP gurus; they all knew those languages and had been using them for awhile, but it didn't take much effort for them to become more productive in Python than they'd been before.</p><br/><br/><p>So if you're talking about new projects with people who currently use PHP but aren't super-experts and don't love that language, then I think switching to Python is a no-brainer.  However, if you're talking about working with a large existing PHP code base with a lot of very experienced PHP programmers who are happy with their current setup, then switching languages is probably not a good idea.  You're probably somewhere in between, so you'll have to weigh the tradeoffs; hopefully my answer will help you do that.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

Most of the problems with multiple inheritance don't apply to abstract base classes, so most modern languages these days disable multiple inheritance yet call abstract base classes interfaces and allows a class to "implement" as many of those as they want.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

    </pattern>
    <template>
<![CDATA[<p>There's a secret 3rd option to the rewrite / don't rewrite decision: rewrite it a bit at a time continuously. This is the genius of refactoring, you don't have to make a monolithic decision to blow the whole works to smithereens and start from scratch, you can approach things piecemeal and work towards a better design as an ongoing goal. Don't rebuild the house from the ground up, instead paint the living room, then remodel the kitchen, then rewire the den, then redo the window, then landscape the yard, then fix the roof, etc. Eventually you end up in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus#George_Washington.27s_axe" rel="nofollow">Grandfather's Axe</a> situation, allowing you to change more over time than you probably ever feasibly could in one huge chunk.</p><br/><br/><p>You can do this at many different levels, making little improvements with most every checkin (using extract method, rename variable/method, etc.) to make chunks of code more readable and more maintainable. Or making big improvements using dedicated budgets, still working incrementally from point A to point B but having the firm goal of reaching point B (the improved design). You can still make breaking changes but you need to be smart about making them. Rather than just replacing some bit of functionality with some completely new way (i.e. API) of doing things you can keep the old bits in place and add new stuff in addition to it, then you can flag the old bits as obsolete and then later delete them, after people have been given enough time to make a graceful transition to the new way of doing things.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

      ACTIC FOR USE PHP IN A HIGH LOAD SITE
    </pattern>
    <template>
<![CDATA[<p>No two sites are alike. You really need to get a tool like <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/" rel="nofollow">jmeter</a> and benchmark to see where your problem points will be. You can spend a lot of time guessing and improving, but you won't see real results until you measure and compare your changes. </p><br/><br/><p>For example, for many years, the MySQL query cache was the solution to all of our performance problems. If your site was slow, MySQL experts suggested turning the query cache on. It turns out that if you have a high write load, the cache is actually crippling. If you turned it on without testing, you'd never know.</p><br/><br/><p>And don't forget that you are never done scaling. A site that handles 10req/s will need changes to support 1000req/s. And if you're lucking enough to need to support 10,000req/s, your architecture will probably look completely different as well.</p><br/><br/><h1>Databases</h1><br/><br/><ul><br/><li>Don't use MySQLi -- <a href="http://ca.php.net/pdo" rel="nofollow">PDO</a> is the 'modern' OO database access layer. The most important feature to use is placeholders in your queries. It's smart enough to use server side prepares and other optimizations for you as well.</li><br/><li>You probably don't want to break your database up at this point. If you do find that one database isn't cutting, there are several techniques to scale up, depending on your app. Replicating to additional servers typically works well if you have more reads than writes. Sharding is a technique to split your data over many machines.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h1>Caching</h1><br/><br/><ul><br/><li>You probably don't want to cache in your database. The database is typically your bottleneck, so adding more IO's to it is typically a bad thing. There are several PHP caches out there that accomplish similar things like <a href="http://ca.php.net/apc" rel="nofollow">APC</a> and Zend. </li><br/><li>Measure your system with caching on and off. I bet your cache is heavier than serving the pages straight. </li><br/><li>If it takes a long time to build your comments and article data from the db, integrate <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/" rel="nofollow">memcache</a> into your system. You can cache the query results and store them in a memcached instance. It's important to remember that retrieving the data from memcache must be faster than assembling it from the database to see any benefit.</li><br/><li>If your articles aren't dynamic, or you have simple dynamic changes after it's generated, consider writing out html or php to the disk. You could have an index.php page that looks on disk for the article, if it's there, it streams it to the client. If it isn't, it generates the article, writes it to the disk and sends it to the client. Deleting files from the disk would cause pages to be re-written. If a comment is added to an article, delete the cached copy -- it would be regenerated.</li><br/></ul><br/>]]>    </template>

      NAME ENTITI IN HTML STILL NECESSARI IN THE AGE OF UNICOD AWAR BROWSER
    </pattern>

<![CDATA[<p>Named entities in "real" XHTML (i.e. with <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, rather than the more frequently-used <code>text/html</code> compatibility mode) are discouraged. Aside from the five defined in XML itself (<code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;gt;</code>, <code>&amp;amp;</code>, <code>&amp;quot;</code>, <code>&amp;apos;</code>), they'd all have to be defined in the DTD of the particular DocType you're using. That means your browser has to explicitly support that DocType, which is far from a given. Numbered entities, on the other hand, obviously only require a lookup table to get the right Unicode character.</p><br/><br/><p>As for whether you need entities at all these days: you can pretty much expect any modern browser to support UTF-8. Therefore, as long as you can guarantee that the database, the markup and the web server all agree to serve that, ditch the entities.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

<![CDATA[<p><code>__construct()</code> would only be called if you called it from within a static method for the class containing the private constructor.

This is the whole point of a Singleton, after all. Using a Singleton for a database connection ensures that your application is not making a ton of DB connections at a time.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

      LIABL SM UNICOD GSM ENCOD IN PHP
    </pattern>
    <template>
<![CDATA[<p>To deal with it conceptually before getting into mechanisms, and apologies if any of this is obvious, a string can be defined as a sequence of Unicode characters, Unicode being a database that gives an id number known as a code point to every character you might need to work with. GSM-338 contains a subset of the Unicode characters, so what you're doing is extracting a set of codepoints from your string, and checking to see if that set is contained in GSM-338.</p><br/><br/><pre><code>// second column of http://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/ETSI/GSM0338.TXT<br/>$gsm338_codepoints = array(0x0040, 0x0000, ..., 0x00fc, 0x00e0)<br/>$can_use_gsm338 = true;<br/>foreach(codepoints($mystring) as $codepoint){<br/>    if(!in_array($codepoint, $gsm338_codepoints)){<br/>      $can_use_gsm338 = false;<br/>      break;<br/>    }<br/>}<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>That leaves the definition of the function codepoints($string), which isn't built in to PHP. PHP understands a string to be a sequence of bytes rather than a sequence of Unicode characters. The best way of bridging the gap is to get your strings into UTF8 as quickly as you can and keep them in UTF8 as long as you can - you'll have to use other encodings when dealing with external systems, but isolate the conversion to the interface to that system and deal only with utf8 internally. </p><br/><br/><p>The functions you need to convert between php strings in utf8 and sequences of codepoints can be found at <a href="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/php-utf8/" rel="nofollow">http://hsivonen.iki.fi/php-utf8/</a> , so that's your codepoints() function.</p><br/><br/><p>If you're taking data from an external source that gives you Unicode slash-escaped characters ("Let's test \u00f6\u00e4\u00fc..."), that string escape format should be converted to utf8. I don't know offhand of a function to do this, if one can't be found, it's a matter of string/regex processing + the use of the hsivonen.iki.fi functions, for example when you hit \u00f6, replace it with the utf8 representation of the codepoint 0xf6.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

It's sort of a baseline low-level <em>lingua franca</em> that other innovation happens atop.  The reason Jeff has been able to get away with not learning C is not because you don't need to know C, but because he learned Pascal which is in many ways isomorphic to C.

There are really only two changes, the addition of the doctype (see notes below) and the addition of the "display: inline-block" attribute on the qrytxt div.

Javascript may be the only thing that can get the effect perfect.</p><br/><br/><p>[EDIT: 6/27/2009]</p><br/><br/><p>Here is another alternative which uses browser specific extensions.</p><br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;html&gt;<br/>&lt;head&gt;<br/>    &lt;style&gt;<br/>    	div.sidebox <br/>    	{<br/>    		width: 26%;<br/>    	}<br/><br/>    	div.sidebox div.qrytxt<br/>    	{<br/>    		height: 1em;<br/>    		line-height: 1em;<br/>    		overflow: hidden;<br/>    		text-overflow:ellipsis;<br/>    		-o-text-overflow:ellipsis;<br/>    		-ms-text-overflow:ellipsis;<br/>    		-moz-binding:url(ellipsis-xbl.xml#ellipsis);<br/>    		white-space:nowrap;<br/>    	}<br/>    &lt;/style&gt;<br/>&lt;/head&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;body&gt;<br/>    &lt;div class="sidebox"&gt;<br/>    	&lt;div class="qrytxt"&gt;<br/>    		Some long text which will arbitrarily be cut off at whatever word fits best but will have an ellipsis at the end.<br/>    	&lt;/div&gt;<br/><br/>    	&lt;div class="qrytxt"&gt;<br/>    		Some more long text which will arbitrarily be cut off at whatever word fits best but will have an ellipsis at the end.<br/>    	&lt;/div&gt;<br/><br/>    	&lt;div class="qrytxt"&gt;<br/>    		Short text.

Maybe i'm just misinformed but as far as I've seen:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/><li>PHPUnit is the standard; most frameworks use it (like Zend Framework (1&amp;2), Cake, Agavi, even Symfony is dropping their own Framework in Symfony 2 for phpunit).</li><br/><li>PHPUnit is integrated in every PHP IDE (Eclipse, Netbeans, Zend Stuide, PHPStorm) and works nicely.</li><br/><li>Simpletest has an eclipse extension for PHP 5.1 (a.k.a. old) and nothing else.</li><br/><li>PHPUnit works fine with every continuous integration server since it outputs all standard log files for code coverage and test reports.</li><br/><li>Simpletest does not. While this is not a big problem to start with it will bite you big time once you stop "just testing" and start developing software (Yes that statement is  provocative :) Don't take it too seriously).</li><br/><li>PHPUnit is activly mainted, stable and works great for every codebase, every scenario and every way you want to write your tests.</li><br/><li>**SimpleTest is unmaintained, outdated and does not work well with PHP 5.3 which released over 2 year ago!.</li><br/><li>(Subjective) <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.6/en/code-coverage-analysis.html">PHPUnit provides much nicer</a> code coverage reports <a href="http://www.simpletest.org/en/reporter_documentation.html">than Simpletest</a></li><br/><li>With PHPUnit you also get these reports inside your IDE (<a href="http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/phpunit.html">Netbeans</a>, Eclipse, ...)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>I've yet to see any argument in favor of Simpletest.  It's not even simpler to install since PHPUnit is available via pear:</p><br/><br/><pre><code>pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de<br/>pear install phpunit/PHPUnit<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>and the "first test" looks pretty much the same.</p><br/><br/><p>For everything you want to test PHPUnit will have a solution and you will be able to find help pretty much anywhere (SO, #phpunit irc channel on freenode, pretty much every php developer ;) )</p><br/><br/><p>Please correct me if i've stated something wrong or forgot something :)</p><br/><br/><h1>Overview of PHP Testing tools</h1><br/><br/><p>Video: <a href="http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw11/schedule/sebastian-bergmann/">http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw11/schedule/sebastian-bergmann/</a></p><br/><br/><p>Slides: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sebastian_bergmann/the-php-testers-toolbox-osi-days-2011">http://www.slideshare.net/sebastian_bergmann/the-php-testers-toolbox-osi-days-2011</a></p><br/><br/><p>It mentions stuff like <a href="https://github.com/mageekguy/atoum">Atoum</a> which calls its self: "A simple, modern and intuitive unit testing framework for PHP!"</p><br/><br/><hr><br/><br/><h3>Full disclosure</h3><br/><br/><p>I've originally written this answer Jan. 2011 where I had no affiliation with any PHP Testing project.

<![CDATA[<p>If your goal is to have user-friendly URLs throughout your application, use the following approach:</p><br/><br/><p>1) Create a routing rule for your module/action in the application's routing.yml file.  The following example is a routing rule for an action that shows the most recent questions in an application, defaulting to page 1 (using a pager):</p><br/><br/><pre><code>recent_questions:<br/>   url:    questions/recent/:page<br/>   param:  { module: questions, action: recent, page: 1 }<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>2) Once the routing rule is set, use the <code>url_for()</code> helper in your template to format outgoing URLs.</p><br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;a href="&lt;?php echo url_for('questions/recent?page=1') ?&gt;"&gt;Recent Questions&lt;/a&gt;<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>In this example, the following URL will be constructed: <code>http://myapp/questions/recent/1.html</code>.</p><br/><br/><p>3) Incoming URLs (requests) will be analyzed by the routing system, and if a pattern match is found in the routing rule configuration, the named wildcards (ie. the <code>:/page</code> portion of the URL) will become request parameters.</p><br/><br/><p>You can also use the <code>link_to()</code> helper to output a URL without using the HTML <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

      DIFFFER BETWEEN THE AND OR OPER
    </pattern>
    <template>
<![CDATA[<p>Just like the &amp; and &amp;&amp; operator, the double Operator is a "short-circuit" operator.</p><br/><br/><p>For example:</p><br/><br/><pre><code>if(condition1 || condition2 || condition3)<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>If condition1 is true, condition 2 and 3 will NOT be checked.</p><br/><br/><pre><code>if(condition1 | condition2 | condition3)<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>This will check conditions 2 and 3, even if 1 is already true. As your conditions can be quite expensive functions, you can get a good performance boost by using them.</p><br/><br/><p>There is one big caveat, NullReferences or similar problems. For example:</p><br/><br/><pre><code>if(class != null &amp;&amp; class.someVar &lt; 20)<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>If class is null, the if-statement will stop after "class != null" is false. If you only use &amp;, it will try to check class.someVar and you get a nice NullReferenceException. With the Or-Operator that may not be that much of a trap as it's unlikely that you trigger something bad, but it's something to keep in mind.</p><br/><br/><p>No one ever uses the single &amp; or | operators though, unless you have a design where each condition is a function that HAS the be executed. Sounds like a design smell, but sometimes (rarely) it's a clean way to do stuff. The &amp; operator does "run these 3 functions, and if one of them returns false, execute the else block", while the | does "only run the else block if none return false" - can be useful, but as said, often it's a design smell.</p><br/><br/><p>There is a Second use of the | and &amp; operator though: <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/chandrahundigam/BitWiserOpsInCS11082005050940AM/BitWiserOpsInCS.aspx" rel="nofollow">Bitwise Operations</a>.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

      MANAG SQL QUERI
    </pattern>
    <template>
<![CDATA[<p>The best course of action for you will depend on how you are approaching your data access. There are three approaches you can take:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/><li>Use stored procedures</li><br/><li>Keep the queries in the code (but put all your queries into functions and fix everything to use PDO for parameters, as mentioned earlier)</li><br/><li>Use an ORM tool</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If you want to pass your own raw SQL to the database engine then stored procedures would be the way to go if all you want to do is get the raw SQL out of your PHP code but keep it relatively unchanged. The stored procedures vs raw SQL debate is a bit of a holy war, but K. Scott Allen makes an excellent point - albeit a throwaway one - in an article about <a href="http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2008/02/02/11737.aspx" rel="nofollow">versioning databases</a>: </p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Secondly, stored procedures have fallen out of favor in my eyes. I came from the WinDNA school of indoctrination that said stored procedures should be used all the time. Today, I see stored procedures as an API layer for the database. This is good if you need an API layer at the database level, but I see lots of applications incurring the overhead of creating and maintaining an extra API layer they don't need. In those applications stored procedures are more of a burden than a benefit.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>I tend to lean towards not using stored procedures. I've worked on projects where the DB has an API exposed through stored procedures, but stored procedures can impose some limitations of their own, and those projects have <em>all</em>, to varying degrees, used dynamically generated raw SQL in code to access the DB. </p><br/><br/><p>Having an API layer on the DB gives better delineation of responsibilities between the DB team and the Dev team at the expense of some of the flexibility you'd have if the query was kept in the code, however PHP projects are less likely to have sizable enough teams to benefit from this delineation.</p><br/><br/><p>Conceptually, you should probably have your database versioned. Practically speaking, however, you're far more likely to have just your code versioned than you are to have your database versioned. You are likely to be changing your queries when you are making changes to your code, but if you are changing the queries in stored procedures stored against the database then you probably won't be checking those in when you check the code in and you lose many of the benefits of versioning for a significant area of your application.</p><br/><br/><p>Regardless of whether or not you elect not to use stored procedures though, you should at the very least ensure that each database operation is stored in an independent function rather than being embedded into each of your page's scripts - essentially an API layer for your DB which is maintained and versioned with your code. If you're using stored procedures, this will effectively mean you have two API layers for your DB, one with the code and one with the DB, which you may feel unnecessarily complicates things if your project does not have separate teams. I certainly do.</p><br/><br/><p>If the issue is one of code neatness, there are ways to make code with SQL jammed in it more presentable, and the UserManager class shown below is a good way to start - the class only contains queries which relate to the 'user' table, each query has its own method in the class and the queries are indented into the prepare statements and formatted as you would format them in a stored procedure.</p><br/><br/><pre><code>// UserManager.php:<br/><br/>class UserManager<br/>{<br/>    function getUsers()<br/>    {<br/>        $pdo = new PDO(...);<br/>        $stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare('<br/>            SELECT       u.userId as id,<br/>                         u.userName,<br/>                         g.groupId,<br/>                         g.groupName<br/>            FROM         user u<br/>            INNER JOIN   group g<br/>            ON           u.groupId = g.groupId<br/>            ORDER BY     u.userName, g.groupName<br/>        ');<br/>        // iterate over result and prepare return value<br/>    }<br/><br/>    function getUser($id) {<br/>        // db code here<br/>    }<br/>}<br/><br/>// index.php:<br/>require_once("UserManager.php");<br/>$um = new UserManager;<br/>$users = $um-&gt;getUsers();<br/>foreach ($users as $user) echo $user['name'];<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>However, if your queries are quite similar but you have huge numbers of permutations in your query conditions like complicated paging, sorting, filtering, etc, an Object/Relational mapper tool is probably the way to go, although the process of overhauling your existing code to make use of the tool could be quite complicated.</p><br/><br/><p>If you decide to investigate ORM tools, you should look at <a href="http://propel.phpdb.org/" rel="nofollow">Propel</a>, the ActiveRecord component of <a href="http://yiiframework.com" rel="nofollow">Yii</a>, or the king-daddy PHP ORM, <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Doctrine</a>. Each of these gives you the ability to programmatically build queries to your database with all manner of complicated logic. Doctrine is the most fully featured, allowing you to template your database with things like the <a href="http://www.developersdex.com/gurus/articles/112.asp" rel="nofollow">Nested Set tree pattern</a> out of the box.</p><br/><br/><p>In terms of performance, stored procedures are the fastest, but generally not by much over raw sql. ORM tools can have a significant performance impact in a number of ways - inefficient or redundant querying, huge file IO while loading the ORM libraries on each request, dynamic SQL generation on each query... all of these things can have an impact, but the use of an ORM tool can drastically increase the power available to you with a much smaller amount of code than creating your own DB layer with manual queries.</p><br/><br/><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37791/how-do-you-manage-sql-queries#38053">Gary Richardson</a> is absolutely right though, if you're going to continue to use SQL in your code you should always be using PDO's prepared statements to handle the parameters regardless of whether you're using a query or a stored procedure. The sanitisation of input is performed for you by PDO.</p><br/><br/><pre><code>// optional<br/>$attrs = array(PDO::ATTR_PERSISTENT =&gt; true);<br/><br/>// create the PDO object<br/>$pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test", "user", "pass", $attrs);<br/><br/>// also optional, but it makes PDO raise exceptions instead of <br/>// PHP errors which are far more useful for debugging<br/>$pdo-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);<br/><br/>$stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare('INSERT INTO venue(venueName, regionId) VALUES(:venueName, :regionId)');<br/>$stmt-&gt;bindValue(":venueName", "test");<br/>$stmt-&gt;bindValue(":regionId", 1);<br/><br/>$stmt-&gt;execute();<br/><br/>$lastInsertId = $pdo-&gt;lastInsertId();<br/>var_dump($lastInsertId);<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>Caveat: assuming that the ID is 1, the above script will output 'string(1) "1"'. PDO->lastInsertId() returns the ID as a string regardless of whether the actual column is an integer or not. This will probably never be a problem for you as PHP performs casting of strings to integers automatically.</p><br/><br/><p>The following will output 'bool(true)':</p><br/><br/><pre><code>// regular equality test<br/>var_dump($lastInsertId == 1); <br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>but if you have code that is expecting the value to be an integer, like <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.is-int.php" rel="nofollow">is_int</a> or PHP's <a href="http://au.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php" rel="nofollow">"is really, truly, 100% equal to"</a> operator:</p><br/><br/><pre><code>var_dump(is_int($lastInsertId));<br/>var_dump($lastInsertId === 1);<br/></code></pre><br/><br/><p>you could run into some issues.</p><br/><br/><p><strong>Edit:</strong> Some good discussion on stored procedures <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/83419/stored-procedures-a-no-go-in-the-phpmysql-world#84294">here</a></p><br/>]]>    </template>

<![CDATA[<p>for a start I think your include path should maybe have a trailing slash.

This means that if your include path is relative (as mine is) instead of absolute, then the path at which Loader.php is looked for changes if the file including bootstrap.php changes.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, I have two index.php files in my Zend app, one for the front end, and one for the admin area. These index files each need there own bootstrap.php with different relative paths in because they are included by different index files, which means they <strong>have to be relative to the original requested index file, not the bootstrap file they are defined within</strong>.</p><br/><br/><p>This could explain why your problem is intermittent, there could be another file including the bootstrap somewhere that is only used occasionally. I'd search through all the sites files for 'bootstrap.php' and see all the places which are including / requiring this file.</p><br/>]]>    </template>

      A BOOK TITL FROM AN ISBN NUMBER
    </pattern>
    <template>
<![CDATA[<p>This is the LibraryThing founder. We have nothing to offer here, so I hope my comments will not seem self-serving.</p><br/><br/><p>First, the comment about Amazon, ASINs and ISBN numbers is wrong in a number of ways. In almost every circumstance where a book has an ISBN, the ASIN and the ISBN are the same. ISBNs are not now 13 digits. Rather, ISBNs can be either 10 or 13. Ten-digit ISBNs can be expressed as 13-digit ones starting with 978, which means every ISBN currently in existance has both a 10- and a 13-digit form. There are all sorts of libraries available for converting between ISBN10 and ISBN13. Basically, you add 978 to the front and recalculate the checksum digit at the end.</p><br/><br/><p>ISBN13 was invented because publishers were running out of ISBNs. In the near future, when 979-based ISBN13s start being used, they will not have an ISBN10 equivalent. To my knowledge, there are no published books with 979-based ISBNs, but they are coming soon. Anyway, the long and short of it is that Amazon uses the ISBN10 form for all 978 ISBN10s. In any case, whether or not Amazon uses ten or thirteen-digit ASINs, you can search Amazon by either just fine.</p><br/><br/><p>Personally, I wouldn't put ISBN DB at the top of your list. ISBN DB mines from a number of sources, but it's not as comprehensive as Amazon or Google. Rather, I'd look into Amazon-including the various international Amazons-and then the new Google Book Data API and, after that, the OpenLibrary API. For non-English books there are other options, like Ozone for Russian books. </p><br/><br/><p>If you care about the highest-quality data, or if you have any books published before about 1970, you will want to look into data from libraries, available by Z39.50 protocol and usually in MARC format, or, with a few libraries in Dublin Core, using the SRU/SRW protocol. MARC format is, to a modern programmer, pretty strange stuff. But, one you get it, it's also better data, and includes useful fields like the LCCN, DDC, LCC and LCSH.</p><br/><br/><p>LibraryThing runs off a homemade Python library that queries some 680 libraries and converts the many flavors of MARC into Amazon-compatible XML, with extras. We are currently reluctant to release the code, but may be releasing a service soon.</p><br/>]]>    </template>
