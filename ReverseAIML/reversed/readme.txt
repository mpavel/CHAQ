Reversed aiml is part of the Charlix Project

Largely inspired by a tutorial by Gary Dubuque:
Dynamically Learning AIML http://209.168.21.76/AIMLpad/Learning.htm

A completely new aiml file. For a plain english sentence, 
a bunch of probable questions will be printed in the answers.  

The most compatible interpreter (for development) I tested was Libaiml. Insert the the aiml file in the directory test-app/aiml.
It should work just as nicely with the last Qaiml too. Create a folder inside the directory aiml. Insert the the aiml file in it.
It should work with the last Rebecca. Insert the the aiml file in the directory aiml/annoted-alice.

To add a source link you need to paste your URL in the code of the category SET SOURCE then start with "set source".
